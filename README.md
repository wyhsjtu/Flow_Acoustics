# SD2155 Flow Acoustics Project assignment 2020
## Analysis of a Truck Muffler

* Simulate the truck silencer using SIDLAB (at lab conditions 20 C and 100 kPa) in the frequency range 30-300 Hz
* Import the measurement data obtained at the laboratory exercise into SIDLAB
* Compare the two in terms of the transmission loss (TL) in order to validate your model.
* Once having a satisfactory model, i.e., a reasonably good fit between measured and predicted TL data, test conditions seen in practise can be applied. Choose for example:
T=300° C. The effect of mass flow rate will be neglected here, hence it could still be left as 0 kg/s. Add a one metre pipe upstream of the silencer (connection engine- 
silencer). Normally a so called “tailpipe” is added after the silencer as well. Now try to optimise the length of this “tailpipe” to maximise the attenuation (the insertion loss IL)
in the critical range 50-200 Hz. The tailpipe length could vary in the range 0.3-1.5 m.
